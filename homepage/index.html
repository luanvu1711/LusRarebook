            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <div class="container__intro__body">
                <p>Early in the 19th century, the need for speed, simplicity, and economy in book production led to the
                    introduction of cloth as a binding material and casing as a binding process. These developments, in
                    conjunction with technological advances in the printing industry, led directly to the rise of the
                    publishers' bookbindings: i.e., bindings designed for and manufactured in quantity for a publisher.
                </p>
                <p>This exhibit chronicles the growth of English and American publishers' binding from its infancy in
                    the 1830s to its decline in the early 20th century. Highlighted are the distinct changes in design
                    that reflected not only technical innovations in the means of book production and decoration but
                    shifting social and cultural trends as well. Viewed as a group, publishers' bindings represent a
                    revolution in the history of the book. Viewed individually, each binding offers an often gilded
                    window to the fashion of its day.</p>
                <p>Throughout the eighteenth century, books were primarily published by booksellers who retained part of
                    an edition to sell in their own shop and sold the rest, usually in sheets, to other booksellers. The
                    bookseller/publisher would advertise his publications in two or three styles of binding at different
                    prices, to suit a range of clients. Some of his customers might prefer to commission a binding on
                    their own. The retailers who bought sheets would in turn have their copies bound to meet the needs
                    of their own customers' tastes and pockets. Thus, one edition might be split between several
                    booksellers, bookbinders and styles of binding.</p>
                <p>Some categories of publications were issued stitched, with paper wrappers, as was common in
                    continental Europe. English and American book buyers, who preferred stiff covers, were offered
                    "paper over boards." Along with paper wrappers, this style was intended to be temporary, but was
                    often the only binding a volume would receive.</p>
                <p>By the early nineteenth century, publishing was separating from bookselling and binders began to get
                    larger batches of work directly from publishers. Since the cost of binding fell to them, publishers
                    sought an attractive binding style that was less costly than traditional hand binding in leather,
                    but more permanent than paper wrappers or paper over boards. Bookbinders, struggling to keep up with
                    the increased output of the printing trade and the demands of the publishers, sought a faster means
                    of production.</p>
                <p>The need for speed, simplicity, and economy in book production led to the introduction of cloth as a
                    binding material and casing as a binding process. The dress fabrics silk and velvet had been used
                    sporadically in binding but lacked durability and were expensive. In the early 1820s, the English
                    publisher William Pickering introduced edition bindings in cloth. Pickering's binder, Archibald
                    Leighton, worked to make cloth commercially viable by adding a fill, or sizing agent, that would
                    both render the cloth impervious to adhesive and allow it to take dye evenly. In 1825 Leighton had
                    ready a plain book cloth and, by 1828, a smooth, glazed cloth. To publishers, this new book cloth
                    offered a binding material of some permanence at a cost only slightly higher than paper over boards.
                    To binders, book cloth offered a material that was easier to work than leather, thereby helping them
                    to speed production.</p>
